## Using the Sample Application, Reading the Documentation, and Providing Feedback

Reviewing the CQRS Journey guidance and code, asking and answering questions, reporting bugs and making feature requests are critical activities of the project community: we value your feedback!

In order to become familiar with the functionality of the sample app you can obtain the source code from GitHub (see "[Obtaining the source code](#obtainsource)" below) and compile it locally. While you become familiar with the functionality, you can report bugs or request new features (see "[Report bugs and request features](#reportbugs)" below).   You can also download the current draft of the documentation from GitHub.

We would love to hear your thoughts, be it comments, suggestions, ideas or anything else.
