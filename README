## Using the Sample Application, Reading the Documentation, and Providing Feedback

Reviewing the CQRS Journey guidance and code, asking and answering questions, reporting bugs and making feature requests are critical activities of the project community: we value your feedback!

In order to become familiar with the functionality of the sample app you can obtain the source code from GitHub (see "[Obtaining the source code](#obtainsource)" below) and compile it locally. While you become familiar with the functionality, you can report bugs or request new features (see "[Report bugs and request features](#reportbugs)" below).   You can also download the current draft of the documentation from GitHub.

We would love to hear your thoughts, be it comments, suggestions, ideas or anything else. However, in the end we are creating Microsoft guidance. So we'll happily take your feedback but you need to understand that by providing us feedback in any form you are agreeing that (i) we may freely use, disclose, reproduce, modify, license, distribute and otherwise commercialize your feedback in  any Microsoft product, technology, service, specification or other documentation, (ii) others may use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute and otherwise commercialize your feedback in connection with our products and services, and (iii) you will not be compensated for any of these things. We may incorporate ideas or make changes based on comments you make, or we may make changes to the product that are indirectly influenced by discussions that we have with you and other folks in the community.
